<h1 align="center">CONTRACTOR</h1>
<br />

Verification of Contracts could be quite cumbersome and hectic. There's always a risk of malpractices like changing the contract details without the second party's knowledge. <br/>
Blockchain solves this issue by storing the details over a decentralized immutable chain. <br />
In <b>CONTRACTOR</b>, contracts are created and sent to both parties for confirmation and review before adding it to the chain. From there, it is publicly available and stored safely.<br />
To start using, install `metamask` browser extension and login through that. You will automatically be logged in if you are an old user. From there, create, search and see all your contracts!
